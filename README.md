# NTF2Gen: A generative algorithm for full-atom models of proteins belonging to the NTF2-like superfamily.<br/>
<br/>

This NTF2 generative algorithm samples a wide diversity of protein structures by carrying out backbone
sampling at two levels. At the top level, sampling is carried out in the space of high-level
parameters that define the overall properties of the NTF2 fold: for example, the overall sheet length and
curvature, the lengths of the helices that complement the sheet, the placement of the pocket opening and
the presence or absence of C-terminal elements. We then convert each choice of high-level
parameters into structure blueprint/constraints pairs, which guide
backbone structure sampling at successive stages of fold assembly. In a final sequence design step, for each generated
backbone, low energy sequences are identified through combinatorial sequence optimization using
RosettaDesign.<br/>
<br/>

The NTF2Gen repository contains all the tools for de novo design of NTF2-like proteins. The main script
is CreateBeNTF2_backbone.py, which manages the construction of NTF2 backbones, followed by
DesignBeNTF2.py (BeNTF2seq/Nonbinding), which designs sequence on a given backbone generated by the previous script. To
generate backbones from a specific set of parameters, use CreateBeNTF2PDBFromDict.py.<br/>
<br/>

The fundamental building blocks of the backbone generation protocol are Rosetta XML protocols
(included in the repository) that are specialized instances of the BlueprintBDRMover Rosetta fragment
assembly mover. All checks and filters mentioned in the result section previous to design are
implemented either in the XML files or the python scripts. The design script is also based on a set of XML
protocols, one for each of the described stages. The glycine placement in highly curved strand positions
and the selection of pocket positions are managed by DesignBeNTF2.py.
Pocket positions are selected by placing a virtual atom in the midpoint between the H3-S3 connection and
the S6 bulge, and choosing all positions whose C<sub>α</sub>-C<sub>β</sub> vector is pointing towards the virtual atom (the V<sub>atom</sub>-C<sub>α</sub>-C<sub>β</sub> angle is smaller than 90º), and their C<sub>α</sub> is closer than 8Å.
